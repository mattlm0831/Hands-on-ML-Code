# Hands-on-ML-Repo
# IMPORTANT:
Almost all of this code is not mine, but pulled from the provided examples from the book:

"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"

Author Github Link: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml

I put this repo here to keep track of my progress through the chapters, as well as to facilitate anybody else that would want to utilize copy-able code that relates to the examples. I do not claim to own this code, I am simply creating this as a learning tool for me and anybody else following the book. There are some separate functions and bits of code that I wrote myself, but I chose not to differentiate those.
